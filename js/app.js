// //TODO

// // Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

// // Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, 
// and any goals that you may have.

// // Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer 
// must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by
//  normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() 
//  functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.

// // Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they 
// are correct. Before submitting, comment out (donâ€™t delete) your console.log()
//  messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project .
